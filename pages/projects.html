            <h2>Backend Engineer @ DTR1</h2>
            <h3>Q1 2024</h3>
            <p>DTR1 offers comprehensive data analysis services tailored for power generation companies. Our solutions enable businesses to efficiently monitor the health and performance of their machinery and instruments across the electrical grid. By delivering detailed analysis reports and predictive insights, DTR1 empowers companies to optimize operations, enhance productivity, and ensure reliable power production. <br>
                I worked in the backend team, where I focused on implementing new features for the product. I designed and maintained database structures to ensure optimal performance and scalability. I also wrote and executed unit tests to ensure code reliability and functionality, and conducted integration tests to verify that different components of the application worked together seamlessly. Additionally, I developed and managed APIs to facilitate communication between different parts of the application.<br>

                I always strive to pay attention to detail, tackle problems effectively, and deliver high-quality work. I believe these qualities, along with my communication skills and collaborative attitude, helped me contribute positively to the team's success.</p>

            <h2>Project on fairness in LLM based recommendation systems</h2>
            <h3>Q1 2024 – Q2 2024</h3>
            <p>With the rise of AI assistants and automated systems in our daily lives; it is crucial to examine their accuracy and fairness. The line between personalized user feeds and false biased recommendations can be thin, but important. In this project, Rozhan explored the extent of gender bias in Large Language Models used in recommendation systems, highlighting how such biases can negatively impact user experience<br>
                I examined how transformers work and explored ways to reduce their biases. My focus was on evaluating fairness in large language models (LLMs) and then training them accordingly. My goal was to enhance the existing LLM, improve the code, and retrain the model to make it less biased towards certain characteristics.<br>
                I found this project to be a valuable opportunity to apply my skills to a critical societal issue: the accuracy of our online feeds. It provided me with hands-on experience, allowing me to build components from scratch and plan the project scope and timeline more efficiently.

            <h2>Data Engineer @ Svea Solar</h2>
            <h3>Q2 2023 - Q3 2023</h3>
            <p>Svea Solar is a company focusing on generating and providing sustainable energy. Their goal is to lead the shift to a more sustainable future with solar power by making better solar panel energy systems, batteries, car chargers and smart energy management.<br>
                At Svea Solar, I had the opportunity to work with database architecture and data processing. Part of my role involved designing and implementing a database, as well as creating a pipeline to extract data from necessary endpoints, filter and clean it, and then inject it into the database and AWS buckets.<br>
                Ultimately, I used this data to analyze the performance of the company's products. I was part of a team responsible for new projects and research within the company. I believe my contributions helped the engineering and sales teams gain better insights into the products, which led to improvements and attracted more international customers.

            <h2>Game Engineer @ KTH</h2>
            <h3>Q1 2023 - Q1 2023</h3>
            <p>I wanted to experience game development and expand my skills, so I teamed up with some friends to create a simple multiplayer tower defense game. Our goal was to enable live multiplayer matches, making the game playable on Windows and Linux platforms.<br>
                I designed 3D characters and buildings for the game in Blender, then moved on to game logic and backend programming. Additionally, I focused on designing and implementing game mechanics, physics, and animations using Unity. One of my contributions involved creating a mechanism for matching players and allowing them to enter a live game. This required launching a server where the game state could be saved and communicated to all players.<br>
                Since we were working in a start-up environment, I also took on the role of team leader, ensuring we stayed on track with our plan and that the product manager was satisfied with our progress. I utilized rapid prototypes to test and iterate on gameplay concepts, optimizing game performance and ensuring a high-quality gameplay experience.
